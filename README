jGrade
An Intuitive Java-Based Gradebook Application
2/25/2011
Author: Andrew Bartolo
------------------------------------------------------------------------
This program is intended to calculate grades for the user.  After entering
student names, grades, grade weights, etc., the user is provided with
calculated averages by class, student, and grade.  Grade maximums and
minimums within the class are also displayed.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
USER INSTRUCTIONS:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a command-line interface (CLI) program.  To run the program,
place the .jar file on your desktop.  Then, open Windows command prompt
by going to Start -> All Programs -> Accessories -> Command Prompt.  Type
"cd Desktop" into the command prompt.  Then, type "java -jar jGrade.jar".
The program will now run in the command prompt window.  You may also run
the program from the directory of your choosing by navigating to that
directory in Windows command prompt, and then typing "java -jar jGrade.jar"
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is required to run the .jar file archive
of this program.  JRE may be downloaded from oracle.com.

If a .dat file of the same name already exists in the same directory
when creating a new file, the existing .dat file will be replaced
with the new .dat file.

Filepaths must be in all lowercase letters.  Filepaths must also include
the .dat file extension.  For example, "c:\users\andrew\datafile.dat"
(without quotes) is a valid filepath.

Percentages must be entered as integers, not decimals.  No percentage
signs.

Any plaintext-supporting text editor may be used to view the .dat files
output by jGrade.

Zeroes in the .dat file serve as placeholders.  jGrade will manage these
zeroes automatically.
